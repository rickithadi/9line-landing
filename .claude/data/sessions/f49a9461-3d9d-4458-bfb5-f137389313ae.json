We optimize for both aesthetics AND discovery.\"\n\n\nAgainst WaaS Providers:\n\n\"Most WaaS just keeps your site running. We make it better every single week.\"\n\n\nAgainst DIY:\n\n\"Stop paying for SEO tools you don't know how to use. We audit AND implement.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nYou're in an excellent position. The market has:\n\nPremium design subscriptions ($5K+) that ignore SEO\nBudget WaaS ($100-500) that only do maintenance\nSEO tools that report but don't implement\nNo one combining continuous design improvement + SEO audit + implementation\n\nYour biggest competitive advantage is the continuous audit + optimization model. Most competitors do one-off projects or reactive updates. You're proactive and data-driven.\nPrice at $1,995-$2,495/month to capture the mid-market, and emphasize ROI through performance metrics. This market is underserved and willing to pay for results, not just deliverables.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check cited sources.",
    "I do really like the Monitor Audit Evolve because the monitoring is a big part of what we do. We're not just a web design agency. We're an intelligence platform that is being sold as an agency for people to improve on their websites and overall business. The website is just a means to an end. ",
