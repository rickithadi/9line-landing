    "as far as the landing page goes. here is feedback, what do you think?\n\nFirst, **replace \"Intelligence-driven\" with clearer, benefit-oriented language** like \"faster & better\" or \"data-backed optimisation\". The current phrase caused confusion, and a direct, impactful alternative will resonate more quickly.\n\nSecond, **prioritise and highlight specific, quantifiable results upfront**. Instead of vague claims, immediately showcase strong metrics like \"+167% Page Authority Increase,\" \"-67% Bounce Rate,\" and \"7:1 ROI.\" SMB owners, especially in legal and construction, are skeptical and time-constrained, so showing concrete proof of value is crucial for grabbing their attention and building trust.",
